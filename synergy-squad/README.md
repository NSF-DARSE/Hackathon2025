# Delaware Checkbook Expenditure Analysis - Hen Hacks 2025

## The Big Idea (Problem Statement)

Different state agencies might be buying the same type of thing (like office supplies, IT services, or even furniture) from different vendors at different prices. This means the state could be missing out on big discounts if they bought in bulk!

**The Challenge**: Delaware state departments are potentially missing significant cost savings opportunities by purchasing similar items or services from different vendors at varying prices, rather than leveraging bulk purchasing power.

## Your Team's AI/FinTech Application

We use AI to identify where different state departments are spending money on similar items or services, but perhaps from different vendors or at different costs. It's like finding "buy one, get one free" opportunities the state didn't even know it had.

## Objective (O)
Identify opportunities for cost savings and increased efficiency through consolidated purchasing across state agencies.

## Key Results (KRs)

**KR1**: Use AI (e.g., clustering or topic modeling) to group at least 5 common spending categories across different state departments.

**KR2**: Pinpoint at least 3 instances where multiple departments are spending on the same type of item/service but from different vendors, or with significant price variations.

**KR3**: (Bonus) Estimate the potential savings if these identified purchases were consolidated or standardized.

## Data Source Focus
Delaware Open Checkbook (opencheckbook.delaware.gov) â€“ focusing on "Expenditures" by department, vendor, and spending category.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Delaware's government expenditure data from the Delaware Checkbook to identify anomalies, patterns, and insights in government spending. The analysis focuses on detecting unusual transactions, analyzing department-wise spending patterns, and providing cost-per-employee metrics while specifically targeting opportunities for consolidated purchasing and cost savings.
